;;; Commentary:

;; Optional integration for Emacs Lisp input methods that commit text by
;; inserting into the current buffer.  `hangul-input-method' is the common
;; example: it calls `self-insert-command' directly for the composed syllable,
;; bypassing ghostel's key remapping, so the commit lands in the buffer but is
;; not sent to the PTY.
;;
;; `ghostel-ime-mode' wraps the buffer-local `input-method-function'.  If the
;; input method inserts committed text into the ghostel buffer, the wrapper
;; captures that text, deletes the local insert, and forwards the UTF-8 bytes to
;; the PTY.  The shell then echoes the text through ghostel's normal redraw path.
;;
;; During an in-flight Lisp IME composition, the mode also asks core ghostel to
;; defer redraws via `ghostel-inhibit-redraw-functions'.  This keeps the native
;; redrawer from rewriting the buffer while Quail-style overlays use it as
;; scratch state.  GUI preedit overlays are left to ghostel.el's native preedit
;; preservation path.
