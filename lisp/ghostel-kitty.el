Caps how much memory libghostty's kitty-graphics image store can
hold per ghostel buffer.  Each transmitted image (PNG bytes or raw
pixels) counts; libghostty evicts the oldest image when a new
transmission would exceed this limit.

Set to 0 to disable kitty graphics entirely — image transmissions
are then ignored and no storage is allocated.  Useful on low-memory
systems or for terminals you know won't display images."

  "Image-loading mediums to enable for the Kitty graphics protocol.

The kitty protocol supports four ways for a program to ship image
data to the terminal:
- direct: base64-encoded inline (always enabled, what timg / yazi use)
- file: program names a local file, terminal reads it
- temp-file: program names a temp file, terminal reads and unlinks it
- shared-mem: program names a POSIX shared-memory region

The non-direct mediums let a *remote* program (over SSH, tmux
passthrough, etc.) instruct ghostel to read arbitrary paths or shared
memory regions on the local machine — a privilege-escalation surface.
The default is nil (none enabled), keeping ghostel safe in remote
sessions while still supporting timg, yazi, and other tools that ship
data inline.  Enable individual mediums by adding `file', `temp-file',
or `shared-mem' to the list, e.g. `(file)' for trusted local-only use."

  "Display a kitty graphics image placement in the buffer.
Called from the native module during redraw for each visible placement.
DATA is a unibyte string (PNG or PPM).
IS-PNG is non-nil for PNG, nil for PPM.
ABS-ROW is the absolute buffer row (0-indexed from `point-min'),
already accounting for materialized scrollback (the C side adds
`scrollback_in_buffer' to libghostty's viewport-relative row before
passing it here).  Without that pre-shift, an image at viewport row 0
would render at the top of the scrollback, jumping into the past as
soon as anything scrolled.  May be negative when the image's top is
above the buffer's first line (rare — only when libghostty's scrollback
got trimmed below the placement's anchor).
VP-COL is the column (may be negative — image partially off the left).
GRID-COLS and GRID-ROWS are the cell dimensions.
PIXEL-W and PIXEL-H are the rendered pixel dimensions.
SRC-X / SRC-Y / SRC-W / SRC-H are the source-rect crop in image pixels;
all zero means the whole image (the common case from timg/yazi).

The image is sized to fill its grid cells and then sliced per row, with
each slice applied on its own buffer line.  Slicing — rather than a
single multi-line `display' property — is required for the image to
actually occupy each cell row (otherwise Emacs draws the image once at
the first character of the range and the remaining rows show the
underlying text or stay blank).  Mirrors the virtual-placeholder path's
`:ascent \\='center' and `line-height' clamping so slices tile flush
across rows.

Falls back to PIXEL-W/PIXEL-H when GRID-COLS/GRID-ROWS arrive as 0 —
libghostty hasn't computed the cell layout yet on the first redraw
after a placement (a subsequent layout change would fix it, but the
user shouldn't have to trigger one)."

Two distinct artifacts both surface here:

1. Collapsed overlays.  `delete-region' clamps overlays inside the

   row's zero-width kitty overlays all snap onto the new point-min and
   stack there (dozens for a tall image).  Detected by counting
   zero-width kitty overlays per start-position — more than one at the
   same position is never legitimate (the placement loop emits at most
   one overlay per row).

2. Orphan text-property slices.  When eviction straddles an image, the
   surviving rows keep their `display' slices into a now-incomplete
   image.  Detected by a slice y-offset > 0 at point-min (y=0 would
   mean the row IS the image's top, so it's an intact image's first
