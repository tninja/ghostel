;;; ghostel-line-mode-undo-test.el --- Tests for line-mode undo -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Undo in line mode: recording is armed for the user's input-region
;; edits, the renderer and the snapshot/restore helpers are shielded so
;; their mutations never pollute the undo list, and recording is
;; disabled again outside line mode.  See plans/line-mode-undo.md.
