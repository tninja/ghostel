;;; ghostel-word-boundary-test.el --- Tests for ghostel: word boundaries  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; `ghostel-mode-syntax-table' and the `ghostel-word-boundary-string'
;; defcustom that drives it.  All tests are pure elisp — no native module
;; required.  We enter `ghostel-mode' via `ghostel-test--with-compile-buffer'
;; so the buffer's syntax table is whatever `define-derived-mode' installs,
;; matching the production buffers a user actually clicks in.
;;
;; Tests assert via two paths.  `thing-at-point 'word' goes through
;; `bounds-of-thing-at-point', the call chain `M-f' / `M-b', Evil `iw' / `aw'
;; and isearch word matching follow.  `mouse-start-end' with mode 1 is the
;; call `mouse-set-point' makes for double-click promotion (via
;; `mouse-set-region').  Both share the syntax table here, but exercising
;; them separately catches regressions in either path.

`mouse-set-point' calls `mouse-set-region' → `mouse-start-end' on a
multi-click event; this is the actual call chain `mouse-1' double-click
takes after `ghostel-mouse-release-or-set-point' delegates to
`mouse-set-point'.  The other tests go through `bounds-of-thing-at-point',
